# AAM-based Abstract Interpretation

Abstracting Abstract Machines (AAM) is a relatively recent (2010) approach to understanding, 
implementing, and reasoning about abstract interpretation. The core idea in AAM is to start 
with a regular ("concrete") semantics for a programming langauge, specified in a small-step 
style via an abstract machine. AAM then uses a relatively cookbook approach to massage the 
semantics into a semantics that drives an abstract interpretation.
